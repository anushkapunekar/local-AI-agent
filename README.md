*Local AI Agent with RAG*

This project demonstrates how to build a powerful local AI agent capable of answering questions based on information retrieved from your local documents. It utilizes a combination of open-source tools to create an entirely self-contained, offline solution for retrieval augmented generation (RAG).


‚ú® Features

1.Local Processing: All AI operations run directly on your machine, ensuring data privacy and no reliance on external APIs.
2.Document-Based Q&amp;A: The agent can answer questions by extracting relevant information from your local documents (e.g., CSV files).
3.Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances AI responses by grounding them in factual information from your specific data.
4.Completely Free: Built using open-source libraries, eliminating the need for paid subscriptions to services like OpenAI or Claude.
5.Easy Setup: Get started quickly with straightforward installation and configuration.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language for the agent.
Ollama: For running large language models (LLMs) locally.
Langchain: A framework for developing applications powered by LLMs.
ChromaDB: A local vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings.



üß† How it Works (RAG)

This project leverages the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm:
Document Loading: Your local documents are loaded into the system.
Chunking & Embedding: The documents are broken down into smaller, manageable chunks. These chunks are then converted into numerical representations called "embeddings" using an embedding model.
Vector Database Storage: These embeddings are stored in a local vector database (ChromaDB), allowing for efficient similarity searches.
Query & Retrieval: When you ask a question, your query is also converted into an embedding. This query embedding is used to search the vector database for the most relevant document chunks.
Augmentation: The retrieved relevant chunks are then provided as context to the local LLM (served by Ollama).
Generation: The LLM generates an answer, grounded in the context provided by your documents, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.
